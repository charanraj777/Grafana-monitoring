# Monitoring Servers with Grafana, Prometheus, and Grafana Loki

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to monitor servers using a robust stack consisting of Grafana for visualization, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana Loki for log aggregation. By integrating these tools, you can gain comprehensive insights into the health and performance of your servers.

## Tools Used

- **Grafana**: A powerful visualization and monitoring tool that allows you to create dashboards and alerts.
- **Prometheus**: An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, optimized for time-series data.
- **Grafana Loki**: A log aggregation system designed to work seamlessly with Grafana.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (for running the services in containers)
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose
- Server(s) to monitor

## Installation
